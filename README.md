# Chronic Kidney Disease Predictor
A manually programmed Logistic Regression implementation of a Chronic Kidney Disease predictor, which predicts whether a given patient does or does not possess a chronic kidney disease.

There are two separate programs within this repository.


'logistic-regression-2var.py' is an implementation that utilizes just two features - the Packed Cell Volume and Haemoglobin Level - to predict. It attains an accuracy of 94%.
This algorithm can be run through the following command (when in the working directory of this project):
```
python logistic-regression-2var.py
```


'logistic-regression-allvar.py' is an implementation that utilizes all features in the dataset to predict. It attains an accuracy of 98%.
This algorithm can be run through the following command (when in the working directory of this project):
```
python logistic-regression-allvar.py
```
